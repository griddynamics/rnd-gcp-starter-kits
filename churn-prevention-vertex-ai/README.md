# Churn Prevention Using Google Vertex AI

## Project description

The main goal of this repo is to portray a churn prevention analytic pipeline that provides a risk of user churning in the near/mid future and suggest the optimal treatment plan for preventions. Moreover, the reference pipeline is created by utilizing auto ml capabilities of Vertex AI, which speeds up the process of selecting the optimal parameters of models, while it took over on itself all the difficulties of tracking, maintaining and deploying ml models. This pipeline can be viewed as a starter kit for quick prototyping of churn prediction solutions that can be further customized and extended to create production-grade platforms.
