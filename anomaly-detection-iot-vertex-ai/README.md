# Price optimization notebook for apparel retail using Google Vertex AI 

## Project description

The major goal of this repository is to represent the minimal set of materials required for the above named project to run. The project is described in detail in the following blog-article:

   [Anomaly detection in industrial IoT data using Google Vertex AI: A reference notebook](https://blog.griddynamics.com/anomaly-detection-in-industrial-iot-data-using-google-vertex-ai-a-reference-notebook/)

The goal of the project has been to develop a starter kit for anomaly detection tasks in large industrial systems. 

> [we implemented] a reference Vertex AI pipeline for anomaly detection. This pipeline can be viewed as a starter kit for quick prototyping of IoT anomaly detection solutions that can be further customized and extended to create production-grade platforms.

> The modeling methodology and reference pipeline developed in this article is based on multiple real-world projects implemented by Grid Dynamics.  

The article is accompanied by a Colab notebook 


## Repository structure

The repository includes the following directories (folders):

- `./notebooks` is the folder with a working copy of the notebook(s);
- `./data/input/` contains 2 input data files in CSV-format;
- `./reports` contains image files with the graphical output of the notebook.


## Requirements

The notebook is supposed to be run from a Google-drive via Google's Colaboratory (Colab), a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. Besides this, the following requirements are supposed to be satisfied to run the notebook without any modifications:

- Credentials to github repo `https://github.com/griddynamics/rnd-gcp-starter-kits`
- Credentials for the project `gd-gcp-rnd-price-optimization` at Google Cloud Platform.
- File `requirements.txt` represent the libraries and their versions with which the notebook was tested. This by no means excludes the workability of the notebook with other versions of the libraries.

One also can run the notebook using other GCP accounts one has credentials for. This would require to change some global variables in 1-2 cells of the notebook and also to upload the two input CSV-files into a GCP bucket. 

No specific Python packages are supposed to be installed besides the packages installed by default.

File `requirements-all.txt` contains the list of all installed packages and their versions at the moment of testing. File `requirements.txt` contains only packages explicitely exported by the notebook. By no means this implies that the notebook will not operate properly with other versions of the libraries. The general style of coding used in the notebook is oriented at generic utilization of the libraries and, thus, is very robust in respect to usage of other versions of the packages. 


## How to setup and run project

- Ensure to meet all requirements.
- Upload notebook to your Google drive.
- Run the notebook via Google Colab environment.

It is reasonabe to run the notebook consecutively, cell-by-cell, paying attention to the comments within the cell and to the output produced by each cell. 

At first run, a pretrained Vertex AI Forecasting model is used. To perform training of a new model in Vertex AI Forecasting, one has to set the value of the variable `MODEL_NAME` to `None` in the proper cell.
